## Usage
Clone the repository and change direction to `tictactoe`:

cd tictactoe
```
<p>I recommend to create virtual environment now.</p>

Next step is installation of dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Now run the application:
```
python main.py
```
In two browser windows open [this](http://127.0.0.1:5000/).
<p>For the application to work properly you should open second browser window with different session. I use Chrome and to do that I open latest as a Guest.</p>

<p>Enjoy! :)</p>
